Wed Apr 29 00:06:30 2020:(say) Arturian says, Probably can't use their base cause it's 64x64 and will be a pain to add to. But there's loads of other stuff in there you can make use of.
Wed Apr 29 00:08:12 2020:(say) Koo says, nah 64 64 is great
Wed Apr 29 00:08:12 2020:(say) Koo says, i can jus set the aligment
Wed Apr 29 00:09:04 2020:(say) Arturian says, I meant more for making new stuff, the base has way too many states. xD
Wed Apr 29 00:09:04 2020:(say) Koo says, yeah the base

Wed Apr 29 00:11:37 2020:(say) Arturian says, Was thinking of something like Rising of the Shield Hero, My life as a Slime or Overlord.
Wed Apr 29 00:12:28 2020:(say) Arturian says, But then there's Boku no Hero and Black Clover too.

Wed Apr 29 00:13:20 2020:(say) Arturian says, Well Rising of the Shield Hero, My Life as a Slime and Overlord are all anime where the main character gets stuck in a video game world.
Wed Apr 29 00:13:20 2020:(say) Arturian says, So they all progress kinda like Sword Art
Wed Apr 29 00:14:11 2020:(say) Arturian says, And because they're less mainstream it's more flexible to do whatever I want. xD

Wed Apr 29 00:16:44 2020:(say) Arturian says, Part of the fun! Is SelfTrain meant to be the main source of XP? I tried grinding NPCs but they were all either too strong or didn't give enough XP

Wed Apr 29 00:18:27 2020:(say) Koo says, like using attack ect 
Wed Apr 29 00:18:27 2020:(say) Koo says, so itll be passive + your card for levels
Wed Apr 29 00:18:27 2020:(say) Arturian says, Ah, that's so much better than relying on levels for your primary stat gain
Wed Apr 29 00:18:27 2020:(say) Koo says, having both will be good its like
Wed Apr 29 00:19:18 2020:(say) Arturian says, You could give different races/traits different modifiers

Sat May 23 18:14:30 2020:Kooo (OOC): thatll be what makes it nicer 
Sat May 23 18:48:38 2020:Malak (OOC): would it affect movement speed?
Sat May 23 18:48:38 2020:Malak (OOC): or attack speed
Sat May 23 18:52:03 2020:Kooo (OOC): movement
Sat May 23 18:52:03 2020:Kooo (OOC): there is a attack speed boost for some things
Sat May 23 18:52:03 2020:Kooo (OOC): ichigo bankai has a faster attack rate
Sat May 23 18:52:03 2020:Kooo (OOC): thats the only one ive added that in for
Sat May 23 18:55:28 2020:Malak (OOC): idk about move speed, cuz sometimes controlling the character is a bit tricky. But that is just my opinion.
Sat May 23 18:55:28 2020:Malak (OOC): mostly cuz quincies shoot 1x1 projectiles xD
Sat May 23 18:56:19 2020:Kooo (OOC): lol 
Sat May 23 18:56:19 2020:Kooo (OOC): movement is a bit slow tho 
Sat May 23 18:56:19 2020:Kooo (OOC): i can scale it 
Sat May 23 18:56:19 2020:Kooo (OOC): so you get faster with more you invest and make it about
Sat May 23 18:57:10 2020:Kooo (OOC): the speed when in vaizard or like ichigo bankai 
Sat May 23 18:57:10 2020:Kooo (OOC): at max 
Sat May 23 18:57:10 2020:Kooo (OOC): i can leave it alone for now xD
Sat May 23 18:58:01 2020:Malak (OOC): I mean, can u scale projectile speed with movement speed?
Sat May 23 18:58:01 2020:Malak (OOC): cuz shooting an arrow and being faster than it would be kinda weird xD
Sat May 23 19:01:26 2020:Kooo (OOC): wym
Sat May 23 19:01:26 2020:Kooo (OOC): like being fast enough to dodge a arrow?
Sat May 23 19:16:48 2020:Malak (OOC): no, but being fast enough to shoot the arrow and get hit by it
Sat May 23 19:17:39 2020:Malak (OOC): cuz arrows travel a huge distance (not complaining)
Sat May 23 19:17:39 2020:Malak (OOC): now imagine if you are faster than your arrow, shoot it and then walk in front of it by mistake
Sat May 23 19:18:30 2020:Malak (OOC): or like, u shoot the arrow and the other player is so fast that he can easily dodge it.
Sat May 23 19:18:30 2020:Malak (OOC): it would kinda break the purpose of being a ranged class
Sat May 23 19:18:30 2020:Malak (OOC): cuz ur arrows would be useless
Sat May 23 19:33:52 2020:Kooo (OOC): oh lol i dont think movement would be that fast 
Sat May 23 19:34:43 2020:Kooo (OOC): but yeah i could always speed arrows up with it
Sat May 23 19:36:25 2020:Kooo (OOC): reee
Sat May 23 19:36:25 2020:Kooo (OOC): killed me lol
Sat May 23 19:37:16 2020:Kooo (OOC): but i tested and the speed im thinkin
Sat May 23 19:37:16 2020:Kooo (OOC): is much slower than arrows still

Tue May 26 08:46:36 2020:Kodra (OOC): on a weak hollow
Tue May 26 08:46:36 2020:Indominous (OOC): gains are so nice omg
Tue May 26 08:46:36 2020:Kodra (OOC): why dont you kill weak hollows till you git gud?
Tue May 26 08:46:36 2020:Indominous (OOC): has anyone evr got to 1mill stat points
Tue May 26 08:47:28 2020:Kodra (OOC): dangai weak has 15 hollows that give 15k exp each 
Tue May 26 08:47:28 2020:Kodra (OOC): that are 1 hit
Tue May 26 08:47:28 2020:Kodra (OOC): in the last 2 days no 
Tue May 26 08:47:28 2020:Kodra (OOC): but im in the middle of redoing this system
Tue May 26 08:47:28 2020:Indominous (OOC): exactly
Tue May 26 08:47:28 2020:Kodra (OOC): theres ton fo exp tho
Tue May 26 08:47:28 2020:Greb (OOC): I think the numbers are too high
Tue May 26 08:47:28 2020:Greb (OOC): imo
Tue May 26 08:47:28 2020:Indominous (OOC): wanna keep talking bout gettig good
Tue May 26 08:49:10 2020:Kodra (OOC): which numbers are to high ?
Tue May 26 08:49:10 2020:Greb (OOC): Everything to be honest. Exp. Damage. Stats
Tue May 26 08:49:10 2020:Kodra (OOC): why you say that ?
Tue May 26 08:50:01 2020:Kodra (OOC): i had it at a lower scale 
Tue May 26 08:50:01 2020:Kodra (OOC): but over time people always pushed past 
Tue May 26 08:50:01 2020:Greb (OOC): I feel like if the numbers are going in to the hundreds of thousands, it loses meaning
Tue May 26 08:50:01 2020:Greb (OOC): Having 1 million health and 400k rei doesn't mean much to me anymore
Tue May 26 08:50:01 2020:Greb (OOC): It's harder to comprehend
Tue May 26 08:50:52 2020:Kodra (OOC): yeah true that 
Tue May 26 08:50:52 2020:Kodra (OOC): i tried it lower tho
Tue May 26 08:50:52 2020:Kodra (OOC): and it just doesnt work out as well 
Tue May 26 08:50:52 2020:Greb (OOC): But if I had 1000 HP and someone was dealing 100 damage then it would register that that if I took a couple of those I would be in trouble
Tue May 26 08:50:52 2020:Kodra (OOC): for me at least 
Tue May 26 08:50:52 2020:Greb (OOC): Sure
Tue May 26 08:50:52 2020:Kodra (OOC): i just recently scaled it up lol
Tue May 26 08:51:44 2020:Greb (OOC): What was the thought process behind scaling it up?
Tue May 26 08:51:44 2020:Kodra (OOC): i only scaled it up because i changed rb to reset stats
Tue May 26 08:51:44 2020:Greb (OOC): Aha
Tue May 26 08:51:44 2020:Kodra (OOC): so now you per rb its not as hard to gain those back 
Tue May 26 08:51:44 2020:Kodra (OOC): first rb is slow
Tue May 26 08:51:44 2020:Kodra (OOC): second lil faster
Tue May 26 08:52:35 2020:Kodra (OOC): ect third is fastest with level cap unlock
Tue May 26 08:52:35 2020:Greb (OOC): I still don't understand how it is faster. Do you mean the level is lowered for the second rb
Tue May 26 08:52:35 2020:Kodra (OOC): no 
Tue May 26 08:52:35 2020:Kodra (OOC): when you use self train in focus
Tue May 26 08:52:35 2020:Kodra (OOC): the amount of stat gained will be higher
Tue May 26 08:52:35 2020:Greb (OOC): But the main way of training is by killing hollows
Tue May 26 08:52:35 2020:Kodra (OOC): when you attack someone and the attack gain is activated
Tue May 26 08:53:26 2020:Kodra (OOC): itll be more than before
Tue May 26 08:53:26 2020:Kodra (OOC): this will be for all 
Tue May 26 08:53:26 2020:Kodra (OOC): from attack , geting hit, auto training
Tue May 26 08:53:26 2020:Kodra (OOC): anything that nets gains will be increased
Tue May 26 08:53:26 2020:Greb (OOC): I mean how much different would it be than farming mobs/
Tue May 26 08:54:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): it doesnt matter weather auto or farming
Tue May 26 08:54:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): the gains will be increased the same
Tue May 26 08:54:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): its a proc rb1 stats rb2 stats
Tue May 26 08:54:17 2020:Greb (OOC): Aaah
Tue May 26 08:54:17 2020:Greb (OOC): I see
Tue May 26 08:54:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): and i change it to use the one i want
Tue May 26 08:54:17 2020:Greb (OOC): So the stats I gain per level up after rebirthing will be more than a non rebirthed character?
Tue May 26 08:54:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): yes
Tue May 26 08:54:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): plus all other ways to gain
Tue May 26 08:55:08 2020:Greb (OOC): I see
Tue May 26 08:55:08 2020:Greb (OOC): So a level 100 character that has rebirthed will be stronger than a level 100 character that hasn't
Tue May 26 08:56:51 2020:Kodra (OOC): yeh
Tue May 26 08:56:51 2020:Greb (OOC): I'm level 100 right now
Tue May 26 08:56:51 2020:Greb (OOC): 1000
Tue May 26 08:56:51 2020:Greb (OOC): I should rebirth then
Tue May 26 08:56:51 2020:Kodra (OOC): and a level 100 on second rb will be much stronger
Tue May 26 08:56:51 2020:Greb (OOC): No questions asked
Tue May 26 08:56:51 2020:Kodra (OOC): nah
Tue May 26 08:56:51 2020:Kodra (OOC): i mean yeah
Tue May 26 08:56:51 2020:Greb (OOC): Oh?

Wed Jun 17 00:12:54 2020:Pocket (OOC): honestly the biggest gate is soul frags, ive you lowered the soul lvl cap break req more people would reach it, 10 souls so much

Wed Jun 17 00:19:44 2020:Pocket (OOC): killing 250 aizens on npcs that are sparce with long respawn times aint really that effective
Wed Jun 17 00:19:44 2020:Kodra (OOC): its 100 for 10
Wed Jun 17 00:19:44 2020:Kodra (OOC): maybe not to you but people have deff gotten tons of kills
Wed Jun 17 00:20:35 2020:Kodra (OOC): between mob jaso and phantom
Wed Jun 17 00:20:35 2020:Kodra (OOC): they have 6k+
Wed Jun 17 00:20:35 2020:Pocket (OOC): and yea on paper it sounds good, but the npc count is low with longer respawn times making the quests on grindable by 1 person at a time
Wed Jun 17 00:20:35 2020:Agares (OOC): dont worry
Wed Jun 17 00:20:35 2020:Kodra (OOC): true then las notches gives 2 souls for vastos

Wed Jun 17 00:22:17 2020:Agares (OOC): I had all the ywachs to me tho
Wed Jun 17 00:22:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): tho hitting level cap has exp turn into soulfrags
Wed Jun 17 00:22:17 2020:Pocket (OOC): im just worried your putting content behind something 90% of your players will never reach cause most byond players are adults now without the time to grind endlessly
Wed Jun 17 00:22:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): then farm the 500mil exp quest
Wed Jun 17 00:22:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): no
Wed Jun 17 00:22:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): 90% of the content
Wed Jun 17 00:22:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): is mid

Wed Jun 17 00:23:08 2020:Kodra (OOC): final rebirth?
Wed Jun 17 00:23:08 2020:Kodra (OOC): meant to be unobtainable
Wed Jun 17 00:23:08 2020:Pocket (OOC): not 90% of your content just 90% of your players never reaching it
Wed Jun 17 00:23:08 2020:Pocket (OOC): icic
Wed Jun 17 00:23:08 2020:Kodra (OOC): oh people do tho pretty easily

Wed Jun 17 00:24:00 2020:Kodra (OOC): pure mobbing would be impossible xD
Wed Jun 17 00:24:00 2020:Kodra (OOC): yeh final rebirth will be weaker than you at 100k
Wed Jun 17 00:24:00 2020:Kodra (OOC): which you may not even get
Wed Jun 17 00:24:00 2020:Pocket (OOC): once you hit cap afk training dont do much, cant even catch you up when higher caps have multi stat gain, so afk training only viable till first lvl cap then you better farm souls
Wed Jun 17 00:24:00 2020:Pocket (OOC): or make no progress lol
Wed Jun 17 00:24:51 2020:Kodra (OOC): i mean it gives stats
Wed Jun 17 00:24:51 2020:Kodra (OOC): for sure lol
Wed Jun 17 00:24:51 2020:Kodra (OOC): but to progress levels from 5k ish on
Wed Jun 17 00:24:51 2020:Kodra (OOC): is the 500mil exp drop from quests
Wed Jun 17 00:24:51 2020:Pocket (OOC): yea but those stats wont catch you up and when you one shot all npcs what are those stats good for lol
Wed Jun 17 00:25:42 2020:Kodra (OOC): thats when you turn em all in 500mil a pop + the exp from the kill

Mon Jun 22 06:59:31 2020:(say) Zezen says, so each floor of this game is filled with monsters
Mon Jun 22 07:00:22 2020:(say) Zezen says, you lvl up by killing those monsters or there is a self train verb in training tab

Mon Jun 22 07:01:13 2020:(say) Zezen says, def is always good to start with so you dont get killed to easy but it really goes off your play style

Mon Jun 22 07:02:56 2020:(say) Zezen says, id say both of them would be swordsman 
Mon Jun 22 07:02:56 2020:(say) Sayuki says, ok

Mon Jun 22 07:03:47 2020:(say) Zezen says, also monsters you kill have a chance to drop items like armor and weapons to boost your stats
Mon Jun 22 07:04:38 2020:(say) Zezen says, seeing as how your new i can give you some armor from floor 2 to help you start out
Mon Jun 22 07:04:38 2020:(say) Zezen says, oh and its space bar to pick items up

Tue Jun 30 21:02:36 2020:Prince Sven (OOC): ASSASSIN
Tue Jun 30 21:03:28 2020:Knives (OOC): You could have like the ability to use healing as a trait like in the show
Tue Jun 30 21:03:28 2020:Knives (OOC): He was like the only person to be able to dual weild at first

Tue Jun 30 21:04:19 2020:Kodra (OOC): knvives alrdy got tht
Tue Jun 30 21:04:19 2020:Knives (OOC): Classes should come from choice like a build of skills to make you do what you want
Tue Jun 30 21:04:19 2020:Kodra (OOC): magic blade coming next update
Tue Jun 30 21:04:19 2020:Knives (OOC): Like crits and poison could be a assassian type build for warior class
Tue Jun 30 21:05:10 2020:Knives (OOC): And like a healer could be from skills in wizard . After you earn or find them
Tue Jun 30 21:05:10 2020:Kodra (OOC): ight wrote those down
Tue Jun 30 21:05:10 2020:Kodra (OOC): yeh like group heals
Tue Jun 30 21:05:10 2020:Knives (OOC): ^
Tue Jun 30 21:06:01 2020:Knives (OOC): Mayb everyone can buy a bandage but unlocking/finding the ability to heal others would be cool.
Tue Jun 30 21:06:52 2020:Knives (OOC): And warriors could probably get a shield at some point to take a guardian/paladin approach instead of just a guy with a sword
Tue Jun 30 21:07:44 2020:Prince Sven (OOC): mages skill tree different elements can only pick one maybe unlock two if you lucky ot strong enough 
Tue Jun 30 21:07:44 2020:Knives (OOC): Maybe pets? so you could be a pet tamer but that could be alike super rare since we only saw one in the show
Tue Jun 30 21:07:44 2020:Prince Sven (OOC): classes have stat bennefits so for example guardian gian def and hp easier than others 
Tue Jun 30 21:08:35 2020:Prince Sven (OOC): but if you invest in too many things you will be a master of none!
Tue Jun 30 21:08:35 2020:Knives (OOC): Maybe a mastery tree for skills so if you master a move you can use it without the weapon being equipped?

Tue Jun 30 21:11:08 2020:Kodra (OOC): the classes for elemets for mage
Tue Jun 30 21:11:08 2020:Kodra (OOC): is a bit to much 
Tue Jun 30 21:11:08 2020:Kodra (OOC): for the start since they dont even have any type of class
Tue Jun 30 21:11:08 2020:Kodra (OOC): masteyr for sure 
Tue Jun 30 21:11:08 2020:Knives (OOC): Not classes just moves that could be learned without a wapon 
Tue Jun 30 21:12:00 2020:Knives (OOC): Not like a true skill tree. That would be too much.

Mon Jul 06 23:07:12 2020:Kharsek (OOC): I see
Mon Jul 06 23:11:28 2020:Kharsek (OOC): I don't understand how the self train exp works really well
Mon Jul 06 23:14:01 2020:Kodra (OOC): its like 200 exp
Mon Jul 06 23:14:01 2020:Kodra (OOC): a tick always
Mon Jul 06 23:14:52 2020:Kodra (OOC): then when a stat gain triggers theres a chance for exp to also trigger
Mon Jul 06 23:14:52 2020:Kodra (OOC): that trigger exp goes up the higher level you are
Mon Jul 06 23:17:26 2020:Kharsek (OOC): yh so prob a full run it's the same as like 7 hours of self train
Mon Jul 06 23:17:26 2020:Kodra (OOC): yeh about right
Mon Jul 06 23:18:17 2020:Kodra (OOC): but you also get a lil stat gain
Mon Jul 06 23:18:17 2020:Kharsek (OOC): I'm talking about the stat gain
Mon Jul 06 23:18:17 2020:Kharsek (OOC): the exp is ass
Mon Jul 06 23:19:08 2020:Kharsek (OOC): a run should give me stat points equivalent to 7 hours of self train
Mon Jul 06 23:23:24 2020:Kodra (OOC): how many stat points you get per 100 levels ?
Mon Jul 06 23:49:00 2020:Kharsek (OOC): not sure exactly
Mon Jul 06 23:49:00 2020:Kharsek (OOC): I'll test
Mon Jul 06 23:50:43 2020:(say) Kharsek says, 615
Mon Jul 06 23:54:08 2020:Kharsek (OOC): 10 levels give me 88k
Mon Jul 06 23:54:08 2020:Kharsek (OOC): so 100 will give me 880
Tue Jul 07 00:03:31 2020:Kharsek (OOC): so about 110 levels in a 13 minutes run to floor 14
Tue Jul 07 00:05:13 2020:Kharsek (OOC): and 952k stat points
Tue Jul 07 00:46:11 2020:Kodra (OOC): thats plenty xD
Tue Jul 07 00:46:11 2020:Kodra (OOC): maybe
Tue Jul 07 00:47:02 2020:Kodra (OOC): mhm i could change some on it a bit ill look 
Tue Jul 07 00:47:02 2020:Kodra (OOC): lmk suggestions for it to
Tue Jul 07 04:23:47 2020:(say) Kharsek says, I don't really know how to change it
Tue Jul 07 04:23:47 2020:(say) Kharsek says, I only think the easy levels should be 1-5
Tue Jul 07 04:23:47 2020:(say) Kharsek says, so that newplayers can get ground into the game
Tue Jul 07 04:24:38 2020:(say) Kharsek says, and make it so after 5 the game really begins
Tue Jul 07 04:25:29 2020:(say) Kharsek says, about the high floors, I could say that just because I'm a player, but the exp really sucks
Tue Jul 07 04:25:29 2020:(say) Kharsek says, 900k a run seems a lot but its not
Tue Jul 07 04:26:20 2020:(say) Kharsek says, I'd need about 20 mil more def just to be able to thank non raged form of scorpi
Tue Jul 07 04:26:20 2020:(say) Kharsek says, and I already got 50 mil
Tue Jul 07 04:27:12 2020:(say) Kharsek says, So I'd say 11-15 should get a nicer exp
Tue Jul 07 04:28:03 2020:(say) Kharsek says, I could suggest the amount of exp and cor that would be suitable and prob not that good
Tue Jul 07 04:28:54 2020:(say) Kharsek says, the quests are really missing tho, if we got a few more decent rewarded quests, it'd be pretty good
Tue Jul 07 04:29:45 2020:(say) Kharsek says, a system where everyday the raid could be Automatically opened and closed after a certain amount of time
Tue Jul 07 04:33:10 2020:(say) Kharsek says, btw, put your paypal in the donation thing in Other, theres nothing about how to donate to you there
Tue Jul 07 04:34:52 2020:(say) Kharsek says, u missing administration and ppl who can make u stuff
Tue Jul 07 04:34:52 2020:(say) Kharsek says, thats why I asked u to teach me how to code
Tue Jul 07 04:35:44 2020:(say) Kharsek says, I'm kinda enjoying the game gotta say
Tue Jul 07 04:35:44 2020:(say) Kharsek says, and to solve the problem you said about prices
Tue Jul 07 04:35:44 2020:(say) Kharsek says, why u don't just a 0 out of everything?
Tue Jul 07 04:36:35 2020:(say) Kharsek says, drops, prices, rewards
Tue Jul 07 04:36:35 2020:(say) Kharsek says, nah maybe the exchange idea is better
Tue Jul 07 04:51:05 2020:Tonic (OOC): sup
Tue Jul 07 04:54:30 2020:Kharsek (OOC): hi there
Tue Jul 07 06:26:40 2020:(say) Kodra says, earning to code what i know would be to helpful tho xD cuz im not to adapt
Tue Jul 07 06:26:40 2020:(say) Kodra says, i may do a exchange and use it for higher tier items
Tue Jul 07 06:26:40 2020:(say) Kodra says, yeah the open raid i wanna learn how todo thats a goal 
Tue Jul 07 06:27:31 2020:(say) Kodra says, ight i added my paypal for update lel
Tue Jul 07 06:27:31 2020:(say) Kodra says, i do need admins to run events and such
